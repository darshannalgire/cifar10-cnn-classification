 CIFAR-10 Image Classification using CNN
 Project Overview
This project is part of my AI & ML Internship task where I built a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images from the **CIFAR-10 dataset**.  
The goal was to learn how to process and classify images using deep learning techniques.

 Objective
- Build a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Perform image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset (10 classes of images).
- Visualize training performance and evaluate the model.

Tools and Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

 Steps Completed
1. Loaded and preprocessed CIFAR-10 dataset.
2. Applied Data Augmentation to improve model generalization.
3. Built a CNN model with layers:
    - Conv2D
    - MaxPooling2D
    - Flatten
    - Dense
    - Dropout
4. Compiled and trained the model for 30 epochs.
5. Plotted accuracy and loss graphs to visualize performance.
6. Plotted Confusion Matrix to evaluate classification results.

Results
- Achieved reasonable accuracy on CIFAR-10 test set.
- Visualized training/validation accuracy & loss over epochs.
- Confusion matrix showed classification performance across all 10 classes.
